Assignment 4
Due: April 13th, 2017

Added Garnet string traps
 - Copied new ptruntime.c file from "/cas/course/cisc458/garnet/ptruntimelinux" into ptsrc/ptruntimelinux/
 - Ran 'make' to update the compiled files
 - Added the new pttrap commands to coder.ssl (traps 101 - 109)
 - Removed old char trap definitions (trWriteString, trWriteChar, trReadChar)

Tokens:
 - coder.ssl's input tokens were modified to match semantic.ssl's output tokens

Data kinds:
 - string was added to data kinds (as number 3)

Modules:
 - Moved statement logic from the Statements rule into the declarations loop in the Block rule
 - Statements logic placed at lower precedence than declarations operations in the loop
 - Kept procedure handling as a separate step after this main loop
