The changes were broken into different sections, outlined below, to allow partners to work simultaneously.

Keywords:
 - Old PT keywords were removed from stdIdentifiers
 - New Garnet keywords were added at the bottom of the keywords list in stdIdentifiers
 - The same keywords were likewise swapped, using the same order, in the scan.ssl file.
 - After compiling these changes, the parser.pt file was updated with the new token numers from scan.def. The numberStdIdentifiers was also increased by one to equal 44, to account for the net gain of one keyword.

Character Classes:
- Added the hash, exclamation, question and dollar characters to parser.pt and scan.ssl input and output definitions
- Added Charclassmap entries for each character class added
- Set quote input to look for double quotes instead
- set not input to look for '!'
- Added ssl logic to look for new characters mentioned above
