Assignment 1
Due: February 8th, 2017

The changes were broken into different sections, outlined below, to allow partners to work simultaneously.

Keywords:
 - Old PT keywords were removed from stdIdentifiers (not, until, program, const, procedure, begin, and repeat)
 - New Garnet keywords were added at the bottom of the keywords list in stdIdentifiers (using, val, def, unless, elsif, break, when, module)
 - The same keywords were likewise adjusted in the scan.ssl file to match stdIdentifiers. These are in the same order in both files in order for them to match-up correctly.
 - After compiling these changes, the parser.pt file was updated with the new token numbers from scan.def. The numberStdIdentifiers was also increased by one to equal 44, to account for the net gain of one keyword.

Character Classes:
- Added the hash, exclamation, question and dollar characters to parser.pt and scan.ssl input and output definitions. 
- No 'exclamation' output token was added, as it indicated "not" or "not equal". The differentiation logic is explained in Syntax Tokens below.
- An input token was added for the percent sign. No output token was added for percent signs as they indicate comments, which are discarded.
- Added Charclassmap entries for each input character class added to connect the input token to the caracter.
- Set quote input to look for double quotes instead of single quotes.
- Added ssl case logic in the scanner to look for the new characters mentioned above.

Syntax Tokens:
- The scan.ssl rules have been modified so that "not equal" is generated by "!=" instead of "<>", "equals" is generated by "==" instead of "=", and assignment is generated by "=" instead of ":=".
- pColonEquals was changed to pAssign to have a more accurate name.
- The error eCommentEOF was removed from parser.pt and scan.ssl, as the end of a file during a comment simply means the comment ends in garnet.
- Input tokens for braces were removed from parser.pt and scan.ssl, as they are considered illegal characters (outside of literals)

String Literals:
- as stated above, the quote input indicating string literals was specified as the " character instead of the ' character
- The ' character was changed to an Illegal

Comments:
- The scan.ssl rules were modified so that comments begin with % and end with new lines
- {} and (* *) pt-style comments were disabled
- {} chars were changed to Illegals as they have no use in garnet
