Assignment 1
Due: February 8th, 2017

The changes were broken into different sections, outlined below, to allow partners to work simultaneously.

Keywords:
 - Old PT keywords were removed from stdIdentifiers
 - New Garnet keywords were added at the bottom of the keywords list in stdIdentifiers
 - The same keywords were likewise swapped, using the same order, in the scan.ssl file.
 - After compiling these changes, the parser.pt file was updated with the new token numers from scan.def. The numberStdIdentifiers was also increased by one to equal 44, to account for the net gain of one keyword.

Character Classes:
- Added the hash, exclamation, question and dollar characters to parser.pt and scan.ssl input and output definitions. No exclaimation output token was added, as it indicated "not" or "not equal". No output token was added for percent signs as they indicate comments, which are discarded.
- Added Charclassmap entries for each character class added
- Set quote input to look for double quotes instead
- Added ssl logic to look for new characters mentioned above

Syntax Tokens:
- The scan.ssl rules were modified so that "not equal" is generated by "!=" instead of "<>", "equals" is generated by "==" instead of "=", and assignment is generated by "=" instead of ":=".
- pColonEquals was changed to pAssign to have a more accurate name
- The error eCommentEOF was removed from parser.pt and scan.ssl, as the end of a file during a comment simply means the comment is closed in garnet
- Input tokens for braces were removed from parser.pt and scan.ssl, as they are considered illegal characters (outside of literals)

String Literals:
- as stated above, the quote input was specified as the " character instead of the ' character

Comments:
- The scan.ssl rules were modified so that comments begin with % and end with new lines
