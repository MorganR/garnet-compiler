All parser test files are in tests/parser/. 'tests/' sits level with 'ptsrc/'.
Tests can be run by navigating to tests/parser/ and running ./TestAll.
All tests compare their .exp (expected output) against the -e output found in the .rese files.
Parser tests do not use the .testi or .testo files for additional testing of ssltrace -i output or custom tests respectively, as these were not found to be necessary for this step of the project. The ssltrace -i output can still be found in the {test-name}.resi files, and this was used in debugging.

Diff files showing all changes can be found here as {filename}-{extension}-diff.txt.
