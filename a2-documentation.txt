Assignment 1
Due: March 1st, 2017

The changes were broken into different sections, outlined below, to allow partners to work simultaneously. Most changes were made in parser.ssl, with a few changes to parser.pt and parser.deff for token updates.

The first change was to fix the broken parser from Assignment 1. This was done by removing the added code to the bottom of parser.pt and uncommenting the original code.

Token Changes:
